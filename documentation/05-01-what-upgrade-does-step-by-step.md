# 5.1 What upgrade does (step by step)

1. **Backs up** `docker-compose.yml` and `config/config.js` (`.bak` files)
2. **Updates image tags** in `docker-compose.yml` - replaces `ps-server:X.XX` and/or `ps-client:X.XX` with the new versions
3. **Ensures `DOCUMENT_ROUTING`** config block exists in `config.js` (appends if missing, disabled by default - does not overwrite existing settings)
4. **Ensures `signed-output` volume mount** exists in `docker-compose.yml` for ps-server
5. **Creates `signed-output/` directory** if it doesn't exist
6. **(`--enable-local-eseal` only)** Stages `dmss-digital-stamping-service/` from
   `installation-scripts/assets/`, appends the gated compose service block,
   patches `dmss-container-and-signature-services/application.yml` to use the
   in-network stamping host, pins `SPRING_SECURITY_USER_*` env vars on
   container-signature, flips `STAMP_MODE` to `"local"` in `config/config.js`,
   and activates the `local-eseal` compose profile in `.env`. See
   [Enabling local e-sealing](04-enabling-local-e-sealing.md#4-enabling-local-e-sealing) above.
7. **Pulls new Docker images** - only the services being upgraded
8. **Restarts changed containers** - only ps-server and/or ps-client and
   the new stamping service if applicable; Keycloak, DMSS, nginx stay running
9. **Restarts nginx** to pick up any config changes
10. **Verifies** ps-server startup and prints running container versions
11. **Prints rollback command** in case anything goes wrong
