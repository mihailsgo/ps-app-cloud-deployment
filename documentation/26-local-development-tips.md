# 26. Local Development Tips

- Hosts entry: map your chosen hostname to 127.0.0.1.
- Certificates: use mkcert to create a locally trusted cert and point `nginx/nginx.conf` to it.
- `host.docker.internal`: The public NGINX forwards to 84 and 86 on the host for container/signature and archive services; these are published by compose. This is intentional for Windows/macOS; Linux users may prefer service-name routing (requires editing `nginx/nginx.conf`).
